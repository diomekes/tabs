<div id="lyrics">
peace and love aren't fair
when you're stuck out there
standing on your own
trying to catch a wave

even though i will
even if i won't
even when i signal that we'd get back home
ask me what to say
i'll point to the sky
ask me what i need to tell you a lie
just ask me what i need to tell you all a lie

there's a crowd outside
calling for our lives
peace and love, they're here
living in an old school bus

ask me where i think
i'll say i have to go
is it this in me that strikes your side so bold
ask me for tonight
i'll pat you on your back
and find a way to one day pay you all right back
i'll find a way to pay you all soul right back

peace and love ain't fair
when you're caught on fire
a bird's nest in my hair
fourteen missiles in my gut

so ask me what i think
i'll tell you i owe no one
and leave without another peep or a lie
waving to that crowd
calling for my neck
but tell you what i need to tell you the truth
gonna tell you what i need to tell you the truth

in the redwood pines
they stole out my spine
in this town called zen
i'm asking where it went

the joke about the fog
the one about your dog
the one about where we all seem to get along
lifted from the mines
and sifted through my mouth
a blessing so you'll never have to dig back down
blessings so you'll never have to dig back down

supposing i admit defeat
fearing what comes next
at my master's feet
on the mount of lazarus

ask me what to do
i'll just point to you
and ask you what i need to tell you all the truth
take this second look
imagine what's been robbed
imagine if we wanted we'd all get along
imagine if we wanted we'd all get along
